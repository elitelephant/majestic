# Majestic – On-Chain OTC Desk

## 🔹 One-liner

Majestic brings OTC trading on-chain, enabling whales to negotiate and settle large crypto trades directly on Mantle without slippage, custodians, or CEXs.

## 🧠 Project Description

### Problem
Whales face slippage and market impact when moving large positions through DEXs. CEXs are custodial, often require KYC, and introduce third-party risk.

### Solution
Majestic is an on-chain OTC desk for whales, enabling private, escrowless negotiation and settlement of large crypto trades on Mantle. No slippage, custodians, or CEXs. Built with Mantle SDK, Next.js, and Solidity for secure, high-value DeFi.

### Why Mantle?
Mantle's fast finality and low fees make it ideal for P2P settlement without relying on centralized intermediaries. Majestic becomes a powerful case of L2-native high-value DeFi.
